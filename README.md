# 7.-Boosting-Revenue-with-Marketing-Hypotheses

We work for the analytical department at an online store. With the help of the marketing department, we've compiled a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue. We will prioritize these hyoptheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results. We've been provided with the following data:
- Nine hypotheses on boosting the store's revenue
- Server logs with data on the store's visits from **August 2019**
- Dump file with all orders from **August 2019**
